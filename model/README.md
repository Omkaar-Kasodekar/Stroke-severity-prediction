This directory is intended to store trained model artifacts for the
Stroke Severity Clinical Decision Support System.

Expected files (generated by your training pipeline or notebooks):

- `decision_tree.joblib`
- `gradient_boosting.joblib`

If these files are not present, the API will fall back to a simple
rule-based model so that the `/predict` endpoint still works.
